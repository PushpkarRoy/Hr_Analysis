## ❓ SQL Questions Solved  

Some complex queries and insights explored during the project:  

1. Find top 3 departments with the highest average monthly income, but only for employees who have worked **at least 5 years**.  
2. List employees who have the same **JobRole** but different **Attrition status**, and compare their average MonthlyIncome.  
3. Identify the department with the **highest attrition rate** among employees **under the age of 30**.  
4. What is the **overall attrition rate**, and how does it vary by department?  
5. Show the percentage of employees in each **EducationField** who travel frequently (`BusinessTravel = 'Travel_Frequently'`).  
6. Retrieve employees who have **never been promoted** (`YearsSinceLastPromotion = 0`) but still have a **high PerformanceRating (≥4)**.  
7. Which **age group** has the highest attrition rate?  
8. What is the **average MonthlyIncome by JobLevel**, and how does it compare across genders?
